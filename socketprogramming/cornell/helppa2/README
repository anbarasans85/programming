This directory contains several files that may be used for
programming assignment 2.  The following is a list.

cksum.c:	This file implements functions to compute
                checksums.
cksum.h:	Defines the interface for this tool.
		See the file "cksum.h" for detailed documentation.

eventTimer.c:  	This file implements a tool that can be used
               	to set events to be triggered in future.
               	Each event is specified by a handler function.
eventTimer.h:  	Defines the interface for this tool.
		See the file "eventTimer.h" for detailed documentation.

evil.c:        	This tool implements an unreliable channel at 
               	user level. This tool can be used by diverting
               	calls from sendto function to evilsendto.
               	It performs several operations including 
               	corruption, dropping, duplication and delaying.
               	This tool in turn uses the evil timer.	
evil.h:        	Defines the interface for this tool.
evil.config:	Defines the parameters used by evil.c
		See the file "evil.h" for detailed documentation.
 
utcp.h:		This file lists the interface that needs to be
		provided to the applications.
		In particular, the 8 functions defined in this 
		file must be implemented.
		Also must be adequately defined a macro
		specifying MAX_DATA_LEN.
		See the file "utcp.h" for detailed documentation.

utcp.c:		This file gives a dummy implementation of the 
		above interface. This file also has adequate 
		pointers on how to proceed with the implementation.
		
SampleServer.c:	This file implements the server part of an 
		example application.  This server just echoes 
		back the data it receives.
SampleClient.c:	This file implements the client part of an 
		example application. This client takes input form 
		the console, sends it to the server and outputs the
		response.
		This test application can currently be run using the
		dummy implemenation of utcp.
		However, it will not work if there is unreliability
		in the channel.

WARNING:	Do not use SIGALRM in your utcp implementation.
		Instead use the functions from evilTimer.h

Use the following commands to compile the sample app:

gcc -g eventTimer.c evil.c cksum.c utcp.c sampleServer.c -o sampleServer
gcc -g eventTimer.c evil.c cksum.c utcp.c sampleClient.c -o sampleClient
